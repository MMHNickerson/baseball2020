Pull and Manipulate Baseball data from the web

The goal of this project is to allow the user to generate a set of dollar values for a fantasy baseball auction draft, by using actual player stats from previous seasons to predict fantasy success in the upcoming season.

It uses the baseball_scraper python package (run 'pip3 install baseball_scraper' in your command line), and depends on BeutifulSoup and lxml in order to parse the results of the calls to baseball_reference.com

Documentation for the package can be found here: https://pypi.org/project/baseball-scraper/
